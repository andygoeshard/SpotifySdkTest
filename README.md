   ## üß© Setup Instructions

2. **Create an application** at the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
3. Add your **Client ID** and **Redirect URI** in `SpotifyViewModel.kt`:

  ```kotlin
  private val CLIENT_ID = "your_spotify_client_id"
  private val REDIRECT_URI = "your_redirect_uri" 
  ```

4.Make sure the Spotify app is installed on your device.

‚ö†Ô∏è First-time connection requires Spotify to be opened manually.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
On first launch, if the Spotify app is not running, the SDK will fail to connect.

As a workaround, the app shows a message prompting the user to open Spotify manually.

Once the app has been opened at least once, subsequent connections will work as expected.
